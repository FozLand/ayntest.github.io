Hey girls and boys. George here. I'm just posting to let you know that I'm not dead yet. I've just been very extra super busy with personal stuff. I've been keeping an eye on the server just to be sure it's not crashed or something like that, but I haven't had the time to do anything else. Some of you have written e-mails. I'm going to reply now. Sorry for disappearing like this. I'm still going to quite busy for a while but I'll try not to dissappear.

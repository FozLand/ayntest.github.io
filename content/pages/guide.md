To prevent other players from altering an area you are building in, craft and place a "Land Rush Land Claim" block. Search for it in the inventory crafting guide.


### /showarea
Shows you the borders of the area you are in.

### /landowner
Tells you who owns the area you are in.

### /sharearea playername
This allows "playername" to alter the area you are in if you already own it.  
`/unsharearea playername` revokes this permission.  
You can also use `/shareall playername` and `/unshareall playername` to do the same for **all** the areas you currently own.

### /mayedit
Tells you who can edit the area you are in.

### /unclaim
Relinquishes the claim you have on the area you are in and gives you back your Claim Block.

George here. I'm just posting to let you know that I'm not dead yet. I've just been very extra super busy with personal stuff. I've been keeping an eye on the server just to be sure it's not crashed or something like that, but I haven't had the time to do anything else. Some of you have written e-mails. I'm going to reply now. Sorry for disappearing like this. I'm still going to quite busy for a while but I'll try not to dissappear.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">george</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2015 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:www.ayntest.net,2015-01-31:im-not-dead-yet.html</guid></item><item><title>Emergency Maintenance 2014-12-18</title><link>http://www.ayntest.net/emergency-maintenance-2014-12-18.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We've ran into some trouble with the database and we're working on resolving the issue. At this point we expect it will take several hours until we're back online. We're trying to keep data loss to a minimum. The &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; case scenario is no more than 6 hours of lost data. We'll post as soon as we have news.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">george</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:www.ayntest.net,2014-12-18:emergency-maintenance-2014-12-18.html</guid></item><item><title>Liberty Land map expaneded</title><link>http://www.ayntest.net/liberty-land-map-expaneded.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to let you all know, I've expanded &lt;a href="http://maps.ayntest.net"&gt;the map&lt;/a&gt; so you can now see a little over 4500 nodes in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">george</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2014 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:www.ayntest.net,2014-12-06:liberty-land-map-expaneded.html</guid></item><item><title>Planned Maintenance at 2014-10-07 06:00 UTC</title><link>http://www.ayntest.net/planned-maintenance-at-2014-10-07-0600-utc.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We need to bring the server down for maintenance again.

As part of the troubleshooting I will need to bring the server down for a while on Saturday.

&lt;p&gt;During the day, you will encounter some frindly animals. You can be frinds with them, or you can kill them. I don't care either way. But be careful though! During the night and in the dark, there are monsters. You can't be friends with them, they will try to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craft your sword and get ready to fight!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">george</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2014 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:www.ayntest.net,2014-09-27:mobs-are-live.html</guid></item><item><title>Worldmap is Live!</title><link>http://www.ayntest.net/worldmap-is-live.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce, we now have an amazing interactive map of Liberty Land which you can see at &lt;a href="http://maps.ayntest.net"&gt;maps.ayntest.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">george</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:www.ayntest.net,2014-09-17:worldmap-is-live.html</guid></item><item><title>Planned Maintenance at 2014-09-04 05:00 UTC</title><link>http://www.ayntest.net/planned-maintenance-at-2014-09-04-0500-utc.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Our super awesome admin, sol, needs to do some h4x0r computer magic on our game server to make it more amazing.
